# FYI
ðŸ¦Š Koyote (no, it's not a misspelling) is a simple and fast Telegram bot that integrates with your GitLab (Cloud or Self-Hosted) to notify you about events that happen in your project.

# TL;DR
Run Koyote as Binary
```
KOYOTE_API_PORT=8081 KOYOTE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=abc:11223344 ./koyote 
```

Run Koyote with Docker:
```
docker run -p 8081:8081 koyote:v0.1 -e KOYOTE_API_PORT=8081 -e KOYOTE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=abc:11223344
```

# Chat Utils

Bot now supports some commands:
```
/chatID - Return current chatID
/threadID - Return current threadID (If 0 then you are in General Thread or chat without Threads support)
```

# How Koyote works

1. Koyote receives an event from GitLab
2. Koyote tries to parse the response from the API to known models
3. Koyote templates a message for a Telegram notification
4. Koyote sends the message to a Telegram chat or channel depending on the ID that is received from the WebHook URL

# What is this bot for?

We faced the problem of developers spending a lot of time notifying the team about new MR requests or failed builds and pipelines in the development chat. So I created this bot to make notifications faster and more automated. This bot helps our developers save time by not having to notify others manually and resend requests for new MRs to other developers. That's all.

After testing this bot in my projects for a month and not finding a normal realization of a bot like mine, I decided to create a community version for developers who are looking for something to automate the notification process.
